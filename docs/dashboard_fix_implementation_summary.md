# Dashboard Synchronization Fix: Implementation Summary

## 1. Problem Diagnosis

The root cause of the delayed and "jerky" updates on the PyQt dashboard was identified in the `ReplayViewerEngine`. At high replay speeds, the engine's main loop would advance the simulation clock significantly in a single frame. It would then process all events within that large time-slice at once, creating a massive batch of updates that were sent to the dashboard simultaneously. This resulted in the UI appearing to freeze and then suddenly jump forward in state, rather than updating smoothly.

## 2. Architectural Solution: Event Queue

To solve this, the direct link between the simulation clock and event processing was decoupled by implementing an event queue within the `ReplayViewerEngine`.

The new architecture works as follows:

1.  **Enqueue:** As the simulation `playback_time` advances, all corresponding events from the source file are added to a new internal list, `event_processing_queue`.
2.  **Dequeue & Process in Chunks:** In every frame of the main application loop, a small, fixed-size "chunk" of events (currently 100) is taken from the front of the queue.
3.  **Steady Stream:** Only this small chunk is processed and sent to the dashboard.

This ensures that the dashboard receives a steady and manageable stream of updates on every frame, resulting in a smooth, real-time user experience, regardless of the selected replay speed.

## 3. Code Implementation Details

The following changes were made to `src/engines/replay_engine.py`:

-   **`__init__`:** Added two new attributes to the `ReplayViewerEngine` class:
    -   `self.last_event_idx_enqueued`: An index to efficiently track which events have already been added to the queue.
    -   `self.event_processing_queue`: A list that serves as the FIFO queue.

-   **`run()` method:** The main `while` loop was refactored to implement the enqueue/dequeue logic described above.

-   **`seek_to_time()` method:** This method was updated to correctly clear and reset the queue and its index after a user jumps to a new point in the timeline, preventing stale data from being processed.

## 4. New 'picked' Status for Work Orders

To provide more granular tracking of work orders, a new `picked` status was introduced. The work order lifecycle is now: `assigned` -> `in_progress` -> `picked` -> `completed`.

-   The `picked` status is set immediately after an agent simulates a picking action.
-   This change was implemented in the `agent_process` method of the `GroundOperator` and `Forklift` classes in `src/subsystems/simulation/operators.py`.

## 5. High-Frequency Dashboard Updates

To further improve the dashboard's responsiveness and eliminate discrepancies, the frequency of `work_order_update` events was increased.

-   Previously, the event was triggered every 5 steps of an agent's movement.
-   Now, the event is triggered at every single step, providing a much smoother and more accurate real-time view of the warehouse operations.
-   This change was also implemented in the `agent_process` method of the `GroundOperator` and `Forklift` classes in `src/subsystems/simulation/operators.py`.
